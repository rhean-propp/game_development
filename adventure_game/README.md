# 100 Days of Code

### Author
Hi, my name is Rhean. I decided to start the 100 Days of Code challenge to improve my python skills. You are welcome to follow me along in my journey to creating this little game.

### Description
This project is a text-based adventure game. The genre is tennatively medival-horror. There is no title yet for the game as much of the story has yet to be written. Much of this project's early development is focused on building the game engine. Once the game engine is complete, more story elements will be created.

### Navigation
You can find nearly all of the markdown files in the docs folder. This folder contains the update log, credits for those who've helped me along on this project, resources I've used for completing the project, and the running to do list. Head on over to main.py to obeserve how the game is executed.
